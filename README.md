## Introduction
</p>Hello! My name is Gibelly Xula. I am a fifteen year old girl and in 10th grade. One of my goals for after high school is to go to UCLA for university. Some of my favorite things to do are listen to music, cook, hang out with friends, travel, and go shopping. I was also born and raised in the San Fernando Valley in California. 
</p>
</p></p>I love spending time with friends and family. In my family I have two sisters, my mom, and my dad. I have one older sister and one younger sister. I love going out with my family to the mall, to go out to eat, going on vacation, etc. My favorite places I've been with my family are Mazatenango, Guatemala and Chicago, Illinois. I want to travel more with family to places like El Salvador because my mom is from there or to more places in Guatemala (where my dad is from). I also love going out and spending time with my friends. With my friends I go to their houses, the mall, cafes, the beach, and more. I really love hanging out with friends and family.

</p></p>One of my favorite things I love to do is learn how to cook. Over summer I was learning how to better my handmade tortillas, make pupusas, and I was helping my mom cook dinner. I want to learn more recipes and be able to fully cook many recipes on my own. Over summer my little sister, mom, and I tried learning how to bake. We are currently trying to learn how to make a tres leches cake. I also want to learn how to bake more things from scratch. Something else I love to do is listen to music. Some of my favorite music artists are The Neighborhood, Chase Atlantic, Enhypen, Beabadoobee, etc. Some of my favorite types of music are R&B and Alternative Rock.
</p>
</p></p>I also like reading and watching movies. Some of my favorite books are Never Lie by Freida McFadden and Solito by Javier Zamora. My favorite books to read are thriller books. Some of my favorite movies are all three of the original Karate Kid movies, the Scream movies, Final Destination, and Taken. I want to start watching more movies in the future and get into more TV shows. I don't watch a lot of TV shows but my favorite one right now is the Summer I Turned Pretty. I usually watch a lot of these movies with my friends or with my mom.
