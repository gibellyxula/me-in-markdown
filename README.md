</p></p>I love spending time with friends and family. In my family I have two sisters, my mom, and my dad. I have one older sister and one younger sister. I love going out with my family to the mall, to go out to eat, going on vacation, etc. My favorite places I've been with my family are Mazatenango, Guatemala and Chicago, Illinois. I also love going out with my friends. With my friends I go to their houses, the mall, cafes, the beach, and more. I really love hanging out with friends and family.

</p></p>One of my favorite things I love to do is learn how to cook. Over summer I was learning how to better my handmade tortillas, make pupusas, and I was helping my mom cook dinner. I want to learn more recipes and be able to fully cook many recipes on my own. Over summer my little sister, mom, and I tried learning how to bake. We are currently trying to learn how to make a tres leches cakes I also want to learn how to bake more things from scratch.
